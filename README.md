# China-LongMarch7-Tianzhou2-kOS-Scripts-13-06-2021

kOS ascent script for a Long March 7 rocket in Kerbal Space Program.

It is meant for a Tianhe (China's Space Station core module) rendesvouz,
you should execute the script when the orbital path of Tianhe passes over
the launch site in a northern direction.

The script launches the rocket, performs the gravity turn, separates
burned-out stages but does not fully circularize the craft.

///NOTES:
  -> The script does not perform a rendesvouz or a docking.
  -> Includes .craft files with and without the kOS parts.
  
Kerbal Space Program 1.11.2
